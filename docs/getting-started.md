## Getting Started

Welcome to the `nmessage` documentation.

`nmessage` is a simple, flexible and helpful library to handle messages with
internationalization support for multiple platforms like Bukkit (Minecraft)


### Features

- Use any message source (file, database, JAR file resources, etc.)
- VERY helpful, just use `handler.send(receiver, "message.node")` and let
nmessage do the translation, sending and formatting job
